## 2.0 - Async Connection

Switched connection from Boto 2.0 to botocore, in order to handle tornado async connections. This update leads to some major BC Breaks.

* [BC BREAK] Authentication is now handled by botocore directly, the following configuration values are no more used:
    * AWS_ROLE_BASED_CONNECTION
    * AWS_ACCESS_KEY
    * AWS_SECRET_KEY
    * BOTO_CONFIG
    You'll need to use boto's configuration file directly to handle your server's authentication to S3, or role-based connection. See <https://github.com/boto/boto3>
* [BC BREAK] A new option has been added to configure the AWS region, named ``TC_AWS_REGION``; it defaults to ``eu-west-1``
* [BC BREAK] Option's names have been uniformized as well, here's the old to new options' names mapping:

| STORAGE_BUCKET | TC_AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET |
| RESULT_STORAGE_BUCKET | TC_AWS_RESULT_STORAGE_BUCKET |
